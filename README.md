# Cinema booking app
![moviebookerr](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eae398d-d320-40fe-a008-ed6e2aa53dd1)
React project for a cinema booking system which consists of the visual aspects. This includes 
a few components for choosing seats, selecting movie and filling booking details. However, at
the moment the functionality is not there yet. This project is a copy of https://github.com/karinEkenberg/javascriptmovieseatbookSTART-main
which is the same project but with working functionality. The aim of this project is to make the same
functionality but with React.

## Github Pages
https://karinekenberg.github.io/movieBooker/

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/karinEkenberg/movieBooker.git```
2. Navigate to the right folder:
``` cd cinema-booking-app```
3. Install dependencies:
``` npm install```
4. Start the server:
``` npm run dev```

## Usage
For now the site showcases an UI which:
- Shows a list of movies to pick from (no data available atm)
- Select seats, also shows which seats are avaiable or occupied (although this is not working yet)
- Fill in personal information from the booker (again not working yet)

## Tecnologies Used
- React 
- Vite
- ESLint
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future improvements
- Adding the functionality to fetch data and display it as a list of avaialbe movies.
- Fulfill functions that handles the seat selections.
- Develop a backend that manages all bookings.
- Elevate the UI appearance.

## Why React
There are many reasons to pick React, here are a few:
- Popular and open source
- Speed, because of being a single-page application
- "Easy" to learn
- Reusable components

On a more personal note, here are a few of "my" reasons:
- I am interested in learning to build apps and came across React Native which builds on React
- I will use it during my internship
